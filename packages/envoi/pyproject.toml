Python SDK for building evaluation environments — HTTP servers that test whether AI-generated code actually works.

You write async Python functions that define what "correct" means. Envoi turns them into an API that any client can call.

```python
import envoi

@envoi.setup
async def build(submission: envoi.Documents):
    workdir = envoi.session_path()
    await envoi.run(f"cp -r {submission.dir}/. {workdir}")
    await envoi.run("make", cwd=str(workdir))

@envoi.test
async def hello_world():
    workdir = envoi.session_path()
    result = await envoi.run(f"{workdir}/cc tests/hello.c -o /tmp/test && /tmp/test")
    return {"passed": result.stdout == "hello"}
```
